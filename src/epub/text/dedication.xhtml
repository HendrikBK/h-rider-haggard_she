			<h2> IN EARTH AND SKIE AND SEA <br/> STRANGE THYNGS THER BE </h2>
			<h3> [Doggerel couplet from the Sherd of Amenartas] </h3>

			<pre xml:space="preserve">ORIGINAL PREPARER’S NOTE This text was prepared from an 1888 edition published by Longmans, Green, and Co., London. A number of fragments of Greek text, and sketches, have been omitted due to the difficulty of representing them as plain text. However, small fragments of Greek have been transcribed in brackets “{}” using an Oxford English Dictionary alphabet table, without diacritical marks. </pre>
			<pre xml:space="preserve">PREPARER’S NOTE⁠—UNICODE EDITION A number of fragments of Greek and other text, omitted from the original posting, have been restored in this Unicode text. Sketches, however, have not yet been restored. </pre>
